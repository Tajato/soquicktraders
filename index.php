<p>Hi everyone, my name is Jordane Jackson. I was born In Montego Bay, Jamaica and I recently moved to the United States to pursue a degree in Construction Management at the University of Nebraska. I am also a track athlete for the University of Nebraska and while going through my daily routines of life I realized one day that working a 9-5 job was never the right way to live life the right way and with that being said, I developed a top notch skill for a number of years to fine tune my craft of becoming financially stable. After seeing most of my family go down the path of having a regular job working a 40 to 45 hours a week and seeing how difficult it was to actually pursue life to the fullest extent because of limitations financially I made it my duty to try my best to find some means of one day creating generational wealth. </p>
<p>Based on my past students and the results they have seen I have been really impressed by how dedicated they are to the game and how consistent they have been and in general I am loving how they are growing and evolving as individuals. In a field like this, ONLY those that are dedicated and stay consistent will survive. Those that aren’t dedicated to the craft will end up like everybody else and that is life. 

For those that are new to this, you guys are all welcomed. You do not need any prior knowledge because I will be teaching you every single thing that I know and what you need to know in order to be successful.
